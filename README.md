## ExMAD
Welcome to the ExMAD repository! ExMAD is an innovative open-source project designed to enhance landslide detection and timing using a combination of expert-based methods and cutting-edge machine learning techniques. Our goal is to improve landslide inventories for better susceptibility modeling and risk management.

# Overview
Landslides are a significant hazard to both human life and infrastructure around the world. Accurate inventories are crucial for effective risk management and mitigation efforts. ExMAD addresses this need by integrating expert knowledge with the U-Net neural network to automate the detection and timing of landslides using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.

# Features
AI-Powered Detection: Utilizes a U-Net neural network trained on the Open-Landslide Project's inventory data.
Expert Integration: Combines machine learning with human expertise to improve detection accuracy.
Temporal Analysis: Capable of determining the timing of landslides, enhancing our understanding of landslide dynamics.
Open-Source: Completely open-source, available on GitHub.
